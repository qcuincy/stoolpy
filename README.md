> 
> ```
> from stoolpy import solve_to, euler_step
> import numpy as np
>
> def f(t, X):
>   x, y = X
> return np.array([y, -x])
>
> x0 = [1.0, 1.0]
> t0, t1 = [0, 10]
> dt = 1e-3
> dt_max = 1e-2
>
> t, Xsol = solve_to(f, x0, t0, t1, dt, dt_max, step_func=euler_step)
> 
> plt.plot(t, Xsol, label="ODE Solution")
> plt.legend()
> plt.show()
> ```
